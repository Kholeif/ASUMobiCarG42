we tried to modify our car to make line follower stage.
1/modify yhe code of line follower.
2/we changed the arduino.
3/put another infrared with the old one .
4/changed the speed.
5/we found that when we put the old infrared ,we put it in the opposite direction"the left in the right"
Unfortunately,when we tried to turn on the car it didn't do well.
