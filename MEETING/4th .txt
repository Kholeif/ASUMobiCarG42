*we added the code of ultrasonic sensor to the original code.
*we uploaded the code on the arduino.
*three went to buy some of components we needed"ultrasonic sensor,other sensors".
*three of us constructed the ultrasonic circuit on the car.
*when we tried the car motion ,we found the car motion is right but the ultrasonic sensor stopped the car when it detected any thing in front of the car.
*we modified the code in the second time to solve the problem but we failed so we ended our meeting .
